# Ideas (not in v0.1 scope)

Parking lot for ideas that come up during development. Do not implement
from this file — promote to a milestone or a decision doc first.

- PyInstaller as an opt-in alternative packaging backend
  (evaluate after M0 findings; PROJECT_BRIEF.md section 4).
- Bundled inference runtime (llama.cpp or similar) instead of requiring
  external Ollama — owner question, section 12.
- Unix socket / Windows named pipe transport behind the transport trait.
- Svelte template (`templates/svelte-ts`).
- Temp-file-handle transport for bulk binary payloads (images, audio)
  to replace base64-in-JSON (+33% wire cost) — protocol note §2.
- Warm/model-persistent isolated workers (`@expose(worker={"mode":
  "warm"})`): keep imports + loaded model resident; kill on cancel,
  lazily respawn on next call. The API is already reserved; per-call
  workers reload everything — seconds with torch — so this is what
  makes `isolated=True` usable for AI apps.
- `{"$bigint": "<decimal>"}` tagging for Python ints beyond ±2^53 —
  emitted as `bigint` in generated TS. Until then the codec rejects
  out-of-range ints with a clear error (docs/codegen.md): annotate
  `str` for exact big integers.
- Richer loop diagnostics: event-loop lag is currently a stderr line
  (`event loop lag Ns`, forwarded to the UI). Could become a typed
  notification + a heartbeat timestamp in `pong` params so the host can
  distinguish "loop busy" from "process hung" in the UI.
