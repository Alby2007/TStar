# 0003: Wrap mode — go/no-go after the W0 spike

Decided 2026-11-11. Spike: `spikes/w0-wrap` (launcher + matrix in its
README; manual checklist in CHECKLIST.md).

## Question

Can Pylair support **wrap mode** — displaying an existing Python web UI
(FastAPI, Gradio, Streamlit) in a stock Tauri webview, served on
127.0.0.1 by a supervised launcher — without forking the framework or
the webview?

## Evidence (macOS, all three frameworks)

Everything below was observed live on macOS; the full matrix is in
`spikes/w0-wrap/README.md`.

**Works with no product code:**

- Page load + streaming transports: FastAPI SSE, Gradio queue/websocket,
  Streamlit `_stcore` websocket — all held and interactive.
- Native file-picker uploads through the webview on all three.
- Clipboard copy/paste.
- Launch→ready ≈ 1–3 s per app.
- kill -9 on the server → launcher respawns on a new port → READY →
  webview re-navigates. Verified on all three frameworks.
- App quit reaps the whole server tree (0 survivors) on all three.
- **IPC isolation is a hard pass.** From the remote page `__TAURI__` is
  undefined; `__TAURI_INTERNALS__.invoke` exists but every call —
  `plugin:event|emit`, `plugin:pylair|python_call`,
  `plugin:pylair|python_shutdown`, and a bogus baseline — is rejected.
  Capabilities only ever scope to `URL: local`; remote origins get zero
  usable IPC.

**Known-fixable gaps (all wry handler registrations, not platform
limits):**

- `target="_blank"` / `link_button` external links are silently
  swallowed — no `new_window_req_handler` is registered.
- Downloads land in `~/Downloads` silently with no dialog; FastAPI/Gradio
  additionally *navigate* to display the content, stranding the user
  (no Back, no wired Cmd+R). Streamlit's `download_button` gives zero
  feedback at all.
- Any full-page navigation to an error/JSON response strands the user —
  no navigation recovery exists in a bare webview.
- Gradio had one transient health-probe miss during first paint — the
  launcher's `GET /` probe is too heavy during hydration.

**Framework behavior worth documenting:**

- Streamlit kill -9 recovery: the page simply reloads with **no error
  or reconnect UI** — and the session is gone. Filled inputs come back
  empty; Streamlit sessions are in-memory. After a restart users see a
  page reload that silently forgets their work. This is inherent to
  Streamlit, not a defect we can fix.

## Decision

**Go.** Wrap mode ships as a supported configuration.

Every "does it work at all" question came back yes on macOS, the
security boundary (remote content cannot reach plugin IPC) held
without any special-casing, and startup is 1–3 s. The gaps are all in
wry handler registrations we must add in W1 — none are platform or
framework limits.

## UX decisions for W1

1. **Downloads:** register `download_requested` and show a native
   **Save As dialog by default**, with a config option to save straight
   to `~/Downloads`. A silent save with no feedback is the worst option
   (Streamlit demonstrates it). After saving, reveal the file or show a
   notification.
2. **External links:** register `new_window_req_handler` → open in the
   **system browser**. Register `navigation_handler` to **lock in-place
   navigation to the app origin** (exact loopback origin match — see
   P1-8's structured READY message and origin validation).
3. **Navigation recovery:** add **Back, Reload and Home** to the window
   menu with keyboard shortcuts, so a full-page navigation can never
   strand the user on a dead page.

## W1 implementation notes carried forward

- Health probe: do **not** treat a slow `GET /` during hydration as
  unhealthy. Use TCP liveness or a framework-specific cheap path
  (Streamlit: `/_stcore/health`), apply a grace period after startup,
  and only kill on several consecutive failures.
- Readiness/navigation: replace stderr-scraped readiness with a
  structured `READY` message carrying the URL; validate the exact
  loopback origin before navigating (P1-8).
- The IPC probe becomes a permanent check in the acceptance job so a
  future capability change that opens remote IPC fails CI.

## Gates

Done-gates for *declaring wrap mode done* (not for starting W1):

- Windows and Linux interactive rows in the matrix (VM or CI-driven).
- Health-probe tuning above, verified against a slow-hydrating app.

Not gates: mic/camera prompts (no fixture exposes them yet — test when
a real app needs it) and the session-loss caveat (documented, inherent).
