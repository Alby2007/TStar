"""Isolated-worker entry point: `python -m pylair._worker <module> <fn>`.

Internal protocol (not the wire protocol): reads the call input as one JSON
document on stdin, runs the named @expose'd function from the given user
module, writes {"result": ...} or {"error": ...} as one JSON document on a
PRIVATE dup of stdout, exits 0. Non-zero exit = WORKER_DIED to the parent.

The result channel gets the same stdout hygiene as the runtime's frame
channel (protocol §1): fd 1 is redirected to stderr before user code runs,
so a `print()` inside an isolated function can never corrupt the result.
